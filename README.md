### GitHub Pages (Free)

Your portfolio is automatically hosted on GitHub Pages. To enable:

1. Go to repository Settings → Pages
2. **Choose ONE method:**
   - **Option A (Recommended)**: Select **"GitHub Actions"** as source (uses `.github/workflows/pages.yml`)
   - **Option B**: Select branch: `main` and folder: `/ (root)`
3. Click "Save"
4. If using GitHub Actions, go to "Actions" tab and ensure workflow runs successfully
5. Your site will be live at: `https://goginenirakesh5-stack.github.io/Portfolio/`

**Troubleshooting 404 Error:**
- Make sure Pages is enabled in Settings → Pages

   - Namecheap
